This small utility is for basic server monitoring. What it does is that it monitors your
minecraft-server, and checks if the exit-code is "bad", and if so, it restarts the server.

Very useful if you don't want to rely on things like scripts which are crontabbed to run
like every 30 seconds or so, just to check if the server is up.

With this script you'll only get a downtime of a few seconds meanwhile the server boots up
again. Please note that at this moment the script doesn't check for anything, it just
goes with what you tells it to use, so please edit with care.

Basic installation and configuration:

If you're using the vanilla minecraft-server.jar, just copy this script into your
server directory and chmod it to 755, making it executable. Then just type:

./server-watch.sh

and just like that, you're up and running.

If you on the other hand uses any server mod which requires another jar to be loaded
than default, then you have to edit the $server-variable in server-watch.sh to match
the name of your jar-file. If you're using bukkit, just comment out the non-commented
line and remove the comment in front of the bukkit-line and you should be all set.
